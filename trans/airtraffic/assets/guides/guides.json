While there are transitions from these waypoints onto the ILS, these transitions aren't used often, as vectors are given most of the time. It is possible to clear aircraft for these transitions, at your own discretion through the <code>reroute</code> and <code>route</code> commands. They are named XXXX23/05, depending on the runway configuration. For example, to clear EWG23LA onto the transition from DOMUX to runway 23R, the command would be <code>EWG23LA route DOMUX.DOMUX23.EDDL23R</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airspace\">Airspace</h3>\n<p>The airspace is listed within the German Aeronautical Information Publication under the name of \"Dusseldorf/Köln Bonn\", meaning that the airspace covers Dusseldorf as well as Cologne Bonn.

By 1950 Dublin Airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers and featured three new concrete runways, the longest of which (16/34) is still used today, although the other two are still clearly visible from the air. Runway 10/28 was opened in 1989 and a new runway measuring 3,110 m (10,203 ft) is currently under construction to the north of and parallel to the existing runway 10/28.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statistcs\">Statistcs</h3>\n<p>31,495,604 passengers in 2018, up 6.5% from 2017</p>\n<p>226,181 aircraft movements in 2018, up 4.8% from 2017</p>\n<h2 id=\"abouttheshannonareacontrolcentre\">About the Shannon Area Control Centre</h2>\n<p>The Shannon Area Control Centre is operated by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and controls most of the air traffic over the Republic of Ireland between FL75 and FL245.

After receiving approval from the government to build the airport, 9 years were spent searching for the right location since the airport would have been the largest in the world at the time. It was eventually decided to build the airport in its current location due to lower construction costs than in other locations. They chose to overlook the fact that the area was prone to extreme flooding and dense fog, now a regular cause for delays at the airport. The airport was finally inaugurated in 1949 with 3 runways crossing at 60-degree angles, one of which was closed in 1997 and is now used for long-term aircraft parking.</p>\n<p>Today, Ministro Pistarini International Airport (IATA: EZE, ICAO: SAEZ), known as Ezeiza International Airport, is Argentina's largest international airport, located 22 kilometers southwest of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It is a hub for Aerolíneas Argentinas and LATAM Argentina. It is one of three airports serving Buenos Aires metropolitan area, along with Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (IATA: AEP, ICAO: SABE) and El Palomar Airport (IATA: EPA, ICAO: SADP). The airport is is the country's primary hub for long-haul international flights with flights to every continent, although some domestic flights also operate out of Ezeiza.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aboutbairestma\">About Baires TMA</h2>\n<p>The Baires Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a large, mostly circular area with a radius of 55nm centered at the EZE VOR and a large portion of the Río de la Plata (River Plate / La Plata River) which creates the border between Argentina and Uruguay. The TMA controls flights in and out of Buenos Aires as well as other smaller airports in nearby towns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instrumentprocedures\">Instrument Procedures</h2>\n<p>The procedures in and out of Ezeiza have remained almost identical for the last 30 years, meaning they are a little 'old-fashioned'. Most SIDs follow a 10nm arc around EZE VOR, allowing aircraft to gain some altitude before heading to their departure fixes. The only exception to this rule is the PTA6B departure for aircraft departing from Runway 11 to the East. All the STARs guide aircraft either to the EZE VOR or the Initial Approach Fix of the corresponding runway, to then be vectored onto the ILS by ATC. Procedures contain no climb or descent instructions or altitude restrictions. ATC is therefore entirely responsible for descending and climbing aircraft in and out of the airport. Special attention must be paid to arrivals from the Northeast who follow routes which take them through restricted airspace overhead Buenos Aires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sectorsavailableinopenscope\">Sectors Available in openScope</h2>\n<p><code>Baires Center</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"restrictedairspace\">Restricted Airspace</h2>\n<p>The Baires TMA is home to many restricted areas.

Due to increasing demand and lack of space, the government moved all international flights to Ministro Pistarini International Airport in March 2019, with the exception of flights to Uruguay.

The airport was opened in 1995 with the aim of serving all commercial traffic to Ushuaia. Previously, all traffic was handled by the Ushuaia Aeronautical Base, located just North of SAWH, but it's runway proved to be inadequate for civil aviation, due to its size and orientation. Ushuaia International Airport's only runway (07/25) was designed to comfortably accommodate the numerous Boeing 747s which would fly in from many European cities. Two chartered Air France Concordes also visited Ushuaia in 1999.

In general, propeller aircraft fly Southwest after departure (BOPAT2 and MULLT2 departures), allowing jet aircraft to depart without delay to the South (MODOR2 departure). There is just one standard arrival into TNCM, ULUBA1, which takes aircraft from the borders of the TMA onto the VOR Approach for RWY10, although radar vectors are usually given to guide aircraft into Sint Maarten. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sectorsavailableinopenscope\">Sectors Available in openScope</h2>\n<p><code>Juliana TMA</code> from the surface up to FL150</p>\n<h2 id=\"restrictedairspace\">Restricted Airspace</h2>\n<p>There are two restricted areas within the Juliana TMA, stretching from the French side of Saint Martin to nearby island, Saint-Barthélemy, from the ground up to 2600ft. </p>\n<h2 id=\"airportsofinterest\">Airports of Interest</h2>\n<h3 id=\"tffg\">TFFG</h3>\n<p>Grand Case-Espérance Airport  <br />\n5nm Northast of TNCM  </p>\n<p>L'Espérance Airport, also known as Grand Case Airport, is a public use airport located in Grand Case, on the French side of Saint Martin. The airport is mainly used for flights to Guadeloupe and Saint Barth, as well as private aircraft. It is the second and smaller airport of Sint Maarten, after Princess Juliana. Due to the short length of the runway, larger aircraft, such as the ATR 72-500, are forced to powerback after lining up on the runway for departure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tqpf\">TQPF</h3>\n<p>Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport  <br />\n10nm Northeast of TNCM  </p>\n<p>Formerly known as the Anguilla Wallblake Airport, the Clayton J.

The airport is also known as Gustaf III Airport, Rémy de Haenen Airport and St. Jean Airport. The short airstrip is at the base of a gentle slope ending directly on the beach. The arrival descent is extremely steep over the hilltop traffic circle, making it a famous approach within the Flight Simulation community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tncs\">TNCS</h3>\n<p>Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport  <br />\n25nm Southwest of TNCM  </p>\n<p>The airport, named after the Aruban Minister Juancho Irausquin, has the shortest commercial runway in the world, only 400 meters (1,312 ft) long, flanked on one side by high hills, with cliffs that drop into the sea at both ends. Although the airport is closed to jet traffic, regional airline propeller aircraft are able to land there under waivers from The Netherlands Antilles' Civil Aviation Authority. The most common aircraft to land there are the STOL-capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and BN-2 Islander.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tnce\">TNCE</h3>\n<p>F. D.
